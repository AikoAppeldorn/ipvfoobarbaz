Privacy Policy

IPvFooBarBaz has full access to your web traffic, as this is necessary to
present the table of connection information.  You should however beware that
upon clicking the popup, requests about the IP addresses will be forwarded to
Google's DNS services to find its hostname, and Cymru will be queried (through
DNS) to find the corresponding ASN.

Clicking on the link buttons (for who.is, ARIN, RIPE, IPInfo & BGP.Tools), will
also reveal the domain name/ IP address to these services.
